# Context

# About user
User is high experiences developer and will expect AI to deliver only what is asked, nothing more. 

# Global rules (DO NOT IGNORE)
1. NO COMMENT in the code: we avoid comment writing in code in order to MINIMIZE code length 
2. NEVER touch requirements.txt without EXPLICIT APPROVAL from user
3. You ALWAYS ask user before creating new CSS classes
4. NEVER reboot backend or fronted server, ask user to do it since he's working trough Visual Code Studio with server parameters
5. If user is asking for specific approach you NEVER change it, or try other approach, without USER CONSENT
6. NEVER add a line containing only spaces, CLEAN this line so that it is empty
7. ALWAYS insure that API endpoint api check authentification sicne you're in a SaaS environment, except if user asks you not to.

## Project structure

Root folder is divided with 2 main folders :

### /app : frontend structure made with the following technologies :
- VueJS (^3.4.15)
- reka-ui: (^2.3.2),
- shadcn-vue: (^2.2.0),
- Vite (^6.2.6)
- Pinia (^2.1.7)
- Axios (^1.8.4)

When user asks you a shadcn component you have to do CLI command to get component from shadcn directly. Make sure to use nvm use 22 first and to be in /app folder.

All informations according Frontend technologies available in : app/src/package.json

app folder contains folowing main folders:
- app/src/assets
- app/src/components
- app/src/views -> all the views are in this folder, except reused components that are in components.

In the app/src/views, subfolders are dedidacated to different section of SaaS app:
- app/src/views/website -> view dedicated to websites (WebsiteXXX.vue)
- app/src/views/workspace -> view dedicated to workspace management (WorkspaceXXX.vue)

### /server : backend structure mage with the following technologies :
- FastAPI (^0.115.11)
- Edgy (^0.31.0) (Documentation: https://edgy.dymmond.com/)

All information according Backend technologies available in : /server/requirements.txt

server folder contains following main folders:
- server/models -> all the models used, made with Edgy
- server/api -> API endpoints
- server/cli -> CLI commands
- server/services -> main services used for data treatment

## General practice
Router:
When you're asked to create new pages or routes in router.js, you only have to focus on adding new pages.
You never touch active routes EXCEPT if user STRICTLY ask to, otherwise you would break entire app.

STRICT CSS GUIDELINES:
1. ONLY use existing Vuetify classes for styling (such as pa-4, d-flex, etc.).
2. NEVER create new custom CSS classes, unless absolutely necessary and justified.
3. NEVER add <style> tags inside components.
4. ALWAYS consult the Vuetify documentation before considering any custom CSS solution.
5. If a style is truly necessary and cannot be achieved with Vuetify, add it ONLY in the dedicated .scss files and document the reason.
6. Use Vuetify’s native spacing, color, alignment, and positioning classes IN PRIORITY.
7. Any proposal to create a CSS class must be submitted for approval before implementation.
8. When a specific need arises, ALWAYS search for a Vuetify class that addresses it first.
9. AVOID using v-card components in your templates EXCEPT if it's asked by user
10. When asked for ICON added in template, ALWAYS use PHOSPHOR ICONS and NOT MDI. Add Phosphor icons using vue Phosphor.
11. If user remove your CSS Style, NEVER PUT IT BACK.
12. NEVER recommands or add inline CSS in html or vue 

Backend : 
When you need to create a new model, you need to create Model Class that extends BaseModel.
